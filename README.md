# Over-Voltage-Protection-System-for-Industrial-Loads-using-STM32-microcontroller
This is repository of our EEE 416 course project. In this repository, we organized our project files including all the necessary codes, simulation and PCB files. 

# Working principle
TODO

# Contents
1. Project presentation slide
2. Video link of presentation
3. Simulation files in proteus
4. PCB design file in proteus
5. STM codes in CubeIDE

# Getting Started (Simulation)
1. Firstly open the simulation [file](EEE416_J2021_P10/adc.pdsprj) from proteus.
2. Upload code [hex](EEE416_J2021_P10/ADCconversion4/Debug/ADCconversion4.hex) file generated from cubeIde to the STM32 in proteus.
3. Click the simulation button which will start immediately.
4. (PCB) To generate pcb files we need to open proteus [file](adc_final_pcb.pdsprj) and you will find developed pcb version of it.

# Used Software
1. Proteus 10.1
2. STM32CubeIDE 1.6.1
